<a id="CON_QUALITY"></a>

## Quality

The system must maintain high quality standards across testing and security to ensure reliability and security.

**Test Coverage:**

- Core business logic: 85%+ coverage
- Overall codebase: 70%+ coverage

This ensures:

- [NFR_TEST (Comprehensive Testing)](../requirements/non-functional/test-quality.md#NFR_TEST)
- [NFR_SECURITY (Security Testing)](../requirements/non-functional/security.md#NFR_SECURITY)
