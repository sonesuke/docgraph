# Extensibility Requirements

<a id="NFR_EXT"></a>

## Modular Design

The system architecture must be modular to facilitate future extensions, such as new linter rules or graph analysis algorithms.

### Codified in (Optional)

- [CC_LAYERED_ARCH (Layered Architecture)](../architecture/design/layered-architecture.md#CC_LAYERED_ARCH) Defines modular architecture
- [CC_DEPENDENCY_RULE (The Dependency Rule)](../architecture/design/dependency-rule.md#CC_DEPENDENCY_RULE) Enforces dependency direction
- [CC_SINGLE_RESPONSIBILITY (Single Responsibility Principle (SRP))](../architecture/design/single-responsibility.md#CC_SINGLE_RESPONSIBILITY) Promotes modularity
- [CC_THIN_HANDLERS (Thin Handlers Pattern)](../architecture/design/thin-handlers.md#CC_THIN_HANDLERS) Simplifies extension points
- [CC_ERROR_HANDLING (Error Handling Strategy)](../architecture/design/error-handling.md#CC_ERROR_HANDLING) Isolates error handling
